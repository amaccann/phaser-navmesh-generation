# phaser-navmesh-generation

### Warning: this plugin is still heavy Work in Progress (WIP). It's possibly not stable enough for use in a production product - use at your own risk (for now!) 

This Phaser plugin generates Navigation Meshes from supplied `Phaser.TilemapLayer` data and collison indices thereof. Contains configuration options

### Getting Started:

#### ES6 / Node

import it as you would any other project:

```
import NavMeshPlugin from 'phaser-navmesh-generation';
```

#### Legacy 

If you're doing it the old fashioned way, simply add `<script>` tag after your main Phaser tag:
```
<script src="my/path/to/phaser.js"></script>
<script src="my/path/to/navmesh-plugin.js"></script>
```

Then in your game's JS code:

```
  preload() {
    var plugin = this.game.plugins.add(NavMeshPlugin);
  }

```

#### Usage:

1. First, we need to generate a new navigation mesh using the following method (options are below)


```
var navMesh = plugin.buildFromTileLayer(tileMap, tileLayer, {
  collisionIndices: [1, 2, 3],
  midPointThreshold: 0,
  useMidPoint: false,
  debug: {
    hulls: false,
    navMesh: false,
    navMeshNodes: false,
    polygonBounds: false,
    aStarPath: false
  }
});
```
Params:
* `collisionIndices` an `Array` of collision indices that your tilemap uses for collisions **(required)**
* `midPointThreshold` a `Number` value telling how narrow a navmesh triangle needs to be before it's ignored during pathing (optional; default `0`)
* `useMidPoint` a `Boolean` value on whether to include all triangle edge mid-points in calculating triangulation (optional; default: `true`)
* `debug` various optional debug options to Render the stages of NavMesh calculation:
    * `hulls`: Every (recursive) 'chunk' of impassable tiles found on the tilemap
    * `navMesh`: Draw all the actual triangles generated for this navmesh
    * `navMeshNodes`: Draw all connections found between neighbouring triangles
    * `polygonBounds`: Draw the bonding radius between each navmesh triangle
    * `aStarPath`: Draw the aStar path found between points (WIP debug, will remove later) 

2. Then, to find a path between two `Phaser.Point` instances, call:
```
navMesh.getPath(position, destination, offset);
```
Params:
* `position` is a `Phaser.Point` of your starting _world_ position **(required)**
* `destination` is a `Phaser.Point` of the destination / end _world_ position **(required)**
* `offset` is an offset value to keep a distance (optional, default `0`) 

This method returns two useful pieces of data:

`path` an `Array` of Points that is the shortest path to your destination
`offsetPath` an `Array` containing the _offset_ path, relative to the `offset` value given in `getPath`
